This dashboard gives a range of analyses, including identifying patterns in patient demographics, understanding factors associated with quality of care, patient wait time, and exploring relationships between admit source and hospital utilization. 

Here is the breakdown of all the analysis:





1) Patient wait times

This visual provides insights into the average wait time in minutes for each Admit Source.
